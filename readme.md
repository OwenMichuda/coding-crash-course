# Some Notes

## Things You'll Probably Need to Install
1. VS Code
2. Git (and make a GitHub account)
3. Python

## File Structure
1. What you're reading right now is a markdown file, as denoted by the ".md" at the end. It's just an easy way to format text. I'll be using it for any information pertinent to the lesson, and it should be the first file you open when you move on to a new section.
2. Each folder will also usually contain a python file (denoted by ".py"). You will have to edit those, and execute them in your terminal/IDE integrated command (right click file name to run).
3. Sometimes I'll include another python file with "test_" prepended to it. This will check the corresponding executable python file in the same folder that you did the exercise correct. You can look through these if you want, but you should try working on the executable first. To test your code, change directory to the relevant folder and enter the following command:
```python
pytest <test_filename.py>
```

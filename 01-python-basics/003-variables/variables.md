## Variables

A variable is a name that stores a value so you can use it later in your program. You can think of it like a labeled container: when you write `age = 24`, you're assigning the value 24 to the variable age. This allows you to refer to that value by name, instead of repeating the number throughout your code.

In terms of naming variables, there's some general convetions:
1. Must start with a letter or an underscore
2. Can't use spaces
3. Be consistent with your pattern (lower camel case, snake case, etc.)

Something nice about Python is that variables are dynamically typed, meaning you don't have to declare what data type a variable is. For example, in Java, to declare an integer "age" with value 24, you would write `int age = 24;`. Python instead just looks at the value you're assigning it and fills in the rest.

This means you can also reassign variables to a different data type if you want! More on that in a bit.

# --- Part 1: Evaluating Comparisons ---
# For the following questions, determine if the statement is True or False
# and assign that boolean value to the 'answer' variable.

# 1. Is 50 not equal to 10?
answer_1 = ...
print(f"1. Is 50 != 10? You answered: {answer_1}")

# 2. Is 15 less than or equal to 10?
answer_2 = ...
print(f"2. Is 15 <= 10? You answered: {answer_2}")

print("-" * 25)

# --- Part 2: Writing Comparisons ---
# For the following questions, use the variables provided to write a
# comparison expression that correctly solves the problem.

# 3. Use the '==' operator to check if num_a and num_b are equal.
num_a = 100
num_b = 100
result_3 = ... # Write your expression here
print(f"3. Are {num_a} and {num_b} equal? You wrote: {result_3}")

# 4. Use the '>' operator to check if num_c is greater than num_d.
num_c = -5
num_d = -10
result_4 = ... # Write your expression here
print(f"4. Is {num_c} greater than {num_d}? You wrote: {result_4}")

# 5. Use the '<=' operator to check if num_e is less than or equal to num_f.
num_e = 25
num_f = 25
result_5 = ... # Write your expression here
print(f"5. Is {num_e} less than or equal to {num_f}? You wrote: {result_5}")

print("-" * 25)

# --- Part 3: Challenge with Variables ---
my_score = 88
passing_score = 70
perfect_score = 100

# 6. Write an expression to see if my_score is high enough to pass.
did_i_pass = ...
print(f"6. Did I pass the level? Your expression says: {did_i_pass}")

# 7. Write an expression to see if my_score is a perfect score.
is_perfect = ...
print(f"7. Did I get a perfect score? Your expression says: {is_perfect}")

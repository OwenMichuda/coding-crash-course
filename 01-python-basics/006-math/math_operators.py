# --- Challenge ---

# The Problem: 
# You need to convert a movie's total runtime, given in minutes,
# into a more readable format of hours and minutes.
#
# Your Task:
# Using the 'total_minutes' variable and the math operators, calculate
# the number of full hours and the number of remaining minutes.

total_minutes = 197

# Replace the '...' with your calculations. You must use the 'total_minutes' variable.
hours = ...         # Calculate the number of full hours.
minutes = ...       # Calculate the number of remaining minutes.

# --- Verification ---
# You don't need to change the code below.
# Run the test file to see if your calculation was correct!

print(f"Challenge: Converting {total_minutes} minutes.")
print(f"Calculated: {hours} hours and {minutes} minutes.")

# --- The Grand Finale Challenge: Birdbrain's Giblet Bonanza ---

# ** The Scenario **
# Birdbrain has been saving her giblets all year! It's finally time to see
# what treasures she can trade them for at the Giblet Exchange.
# She has her eye on a few specific items, but the real question is...
# does she have enough for the ultimate grand prize: A Tickle Sesh!

# ** Birdbrain's Starting Info **
# - She has carefully counted 1250 giblets.
# - She wants to get the following treasures:
#   - One (1) Dodo Kiss, which costs 120 giblets.
#   - Three (3) Dodo Hugs, which cost 45 giblets EACH.
#   - One (1) Dodo Meal, which costs 250 giblets.
# - The Tickle Sesh grand prize costs 1000 giblets.

# ** Your Tasks **
# Create a Python script that answers the following questions. You will need
# to create variables, use math operators to calculate totals, and use
# comparison operators to determine the final answers.

# 1.  Create variables to store all the starting information (your total giblets,
#     the cost of each treasure, etc.).

# 2.  Calculate the total cost (in giblets) of all the treasures Birdbrain
#     wants to get (EXCLUDING TICKLE SESH). Store this total cost in a variable called `total_cost`.

# 3.  Calculate how many giblets she will have *left over* after trading
#     for those treasures. Store this in a variable called `giblets_left`.

# 4.  Using a comparison operator, create a boolean variable called
#     `can_afford_tickles_before` that is `True` if she has enough
#     giblets for the Tickle Sesh *before* getting the other treasures.

# 5.  Using a comparison operator, create a boolean variable called
#     `can_afford_tickles_after` that is `True` if she would *still* have
#     enough for the Tickle Attack *after* getting the other treasures.

# ** Final Output **
# After you have all your variables calculated, add print statements to the
# end of your script to see the results. For example:

# print(f"Total cost of treasures: {total_cost}")
# print(f"Giblets remaining after trade: {left_over_giblets}")
# print(f"Can Birdbrain get tickles before trading? {can_afford_tickles_before}")
# print(f"Can Birdbrain get tickles after trading? {can_afford_tickles_after}")

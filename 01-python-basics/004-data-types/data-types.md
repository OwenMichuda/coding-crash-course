## Basic Data Types

In Python, **every value has a type**. This is called a **data type**, and it tells Python what kind of information you're working with—like text, numbers, or True/False values.

- **String (`str`)**  
  A string is any text surrounded by quotes. It could be a single letter, a word, or a whole sentence.  
  Example: `"hello"`, `"A"`, `"123"` (note, numbers wrapped in quotes aren't numbers, they are strings!)

- **Integer (`int`)**  
  An integer is a whole number—no decimal points allowed. Use this when you’re counting or doing math with whole numbers.  
  Example: `3`, `0`, `-100`

- **Float (`float`)**  
  A float is a number with a decimal point. Use it when precision or fractions are needed.  
  Example: `3.14`, `0.5`, `-2.75`

- **Boolean (`bool`)**  
  A boolean represents one of two values: `True` or `False`. These are useful for answering yes/no questions in your code.  
  Example: `is_raining = True`, `is_hungry = False`

You can check the data type of any vartiable by using the `type()` function.
